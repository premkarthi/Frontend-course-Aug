          <h4>Let's take a closer look at each of the props:</h4>
          <li>
            id: string - The id prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed.
            This can be used to identify which part of the tree was committed if
            you are using multiple profilers.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            actualDuration: number - Time spent rendering the Profiler and its
            descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the
            subtree makes use of memoization
          </li>
        </div>
  
        <div class="going">
          <h3>On Going</h3>
          <p>
            phase: "mount" | "update" - Identifies whether the tree has just been
            mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props,
            state, or hooks.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="completed">
          <h3>Completed</h3>
          <li>
            (e.g. React.memo, useMemo, shouldComponentUpdate). Ideally this value
            should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the
            descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props
            change.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            baseDuration: number - Duration of the most recent render time for
            each individual component within the Profiler tree. This value
            estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a
            tree with no memoization).
          </li>
  
          <li>
            startTime: number - Timestamp when React began rendering the current
            update.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            commitTime: number - Timestamp when React committed the current
            update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit,
            enabling them to be grouped if desirable.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            interactions: Set - Set of “interactions” that were being traced when
            the update was scheduled (e.g. when render or setState were called).
          </li>
